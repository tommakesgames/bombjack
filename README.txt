DaBomb (BombJack Clone) Readme
==============================

Nothing exciting here, just a basic prototype clone of Bombjack (classic arcade game from 1984) that I did in Unity.
Beginner's code here. You can download if you want I suppose, but I can't see why you would. The code'll be hideous!
Github repo made for practice purely. That's it.
